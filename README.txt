# Optical Spectroscopy Regression Project

## Overview

This machine learning project is dedicated to studying regression methods, specifically linear regression and multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), in the context of optical spectroscopy. The goal of this project is to develop models capable of reconstructing monochromatic spectra based on measured intensities from images obtained through a microdevice.


## Installation

To set up and run this project, follow these installatio steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
